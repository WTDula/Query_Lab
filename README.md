ORM Querying Lab

Introduction

Object-Relational Mappers (ORM) give software developers the tools to interact with databases purely through the applications object-oriented programming language (such as Python). Rather than writing raw SQL queries with our applications we can instead interact through class objects called “models”. This project is an exercise in becoming familiar and comfortable using ORMs such as Django’s ORM (Django covered soon!). In this project we will be interacting with multiple models to query data in unique was and inspect what SQL is actually being executed “under-the-hood”.

Technologies

Python, MySQL

Learning Objective

The objective of this project is to get more comfortable using the Django ORM query methods to retrieve data from a MySQL database. Many of your future projects, including the capstone, will require you to use similar Django ORM queries that you will be introduced to here. Your proficiency will grow with each project.

Tasks

Work with your team to complete the query lab using a paired programming approach.

1. Complete the required queries in each view.py function.

2. Print your query results to the terminal and attempt to match the provided “Expected Terminal Result” as shown in the comments under each function. (Also shown in the browser)

3. Utilize the Django Debug Toolbar to view the actual SQL that is executed by your ORM queries.

4. Use the web page’s navigation buttons to execute the corresponding functions -->
